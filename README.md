## Active Projects

## Cemetery of Great Ideas

This is a very sad place. But some necromancer might decide to bring one of these projects back, as long as they are [Open Source](https://opensource.org/osd) / [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html).

We bury a project in this cemetary if the most recent commit or public release is at least 2 years old, or if the project was officially discontinued.

* [NoSQL](#nosql) - A relational database that replaces SQL with a set of simple command-line tools.

## Projects Information

### NoSQL

NoSQL is a relational database that doesn't implement SQL. Instead, it uses a set of simple and fast UNIX tools. Each tool replaces an SQL operator and its output can be piped to another operator. It makes use of GNU tools, as well as purpose-created tools written in C or Awk. NoSQL follows the //Operator-Stream Paradigm//.
