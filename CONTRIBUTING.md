## Criteria

A database can only listed here if it brings a potential innovation. There is no requirement for this innovation to succeed, as long as it is interesting.

An innovative database is one that potentially innovates the world, not just a company and its customers. We welcome open source, free software, and source-available projects. We don't want to include projects that don't fall in any of these categories. Open core projects will be considered innovative if the innovation resides in its open source core, ignoring all proprietary plugins.

A database project is innovative while the innovations it brings are new. The most common database systems (such as PostgreSQL, MySQL or MariaDB) might still be bringing innovation, but they shouldn't be listed here.

For this purpose, metadatabases are not considered databases. A database system is a technology that actually stores data, not an SQL interface that interacts with data sources. While some metadatabases are extremely interesting, they shouldn't be listed here.

We understand that these criteria are partly subjective. Also, they might not be exhaustive. Consider theme a generic guideline, not as a normalive regulation.
